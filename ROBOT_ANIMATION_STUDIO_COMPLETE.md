     it's a collaborative robot with excellent precision. 
     How fast should this happen? Quick and efficient, 
     or slow and precise?"

👤 User: "Medium speed with accuracy"

🧠 AI: "Perfect! Here's what I've configured:
     🎯 Task: Pick And Place
     ⚡ Speed: Medium
     🎭 Motion: Linear movements
