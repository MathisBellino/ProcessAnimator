- **Focus Controls**: Automatically center viewport on selected robot
- **Smart Analysis**: Automatic counting and categorization of bones and joints

### Usage

#### Basic Bone Visibility Toggle
```python
# Access via UI Panel: Robot Studio > Bone Visibility
# Click "Show Only Bones" to enter bone-only mode
# Click "Show All Objects" to return to normal view
```

#### Teaching Mode
- Enables bone names, axes, and enhanced visibility
- Perfect for educational presentations and joint analysis
- Color-codes bones by hierarchy (root=red, middle=blue, end-effector=green)

#### Focus on Robot
- Automatically centers view on robot armature

#### Pick and Place
```
"Pick up the tube and place it on the table"
"Move the box to the assembly station"
"Take the part and put it in the container"
"Grab the component and transfer it to the workbench"
```

#### Simple Actions
```
"Pick up the red cube"
"Move to home position"
"Approach the table"
"Place it on the surface"
```

#### Sequential Commands
```
"Pick up the tube, then place it on the table"
"First move to position A, then grab the part"
"Approach the object and then pick it up"
```

### Usage

#### Via UI Panel

3. Type your instruction (e.g., "pick up the tube and place it on the table")
4. Click **Execute**

#### Quick Commands
- Use pre-defined buttons for common actions
- "Pick up tube", "Place on table", "Move to assembly"

### Command Processing Pipeline
1. **Text Parsing**: Extract objects and actions from natural language
2. **Scene Analysis**: Find referenced objects in the current scene
3. **Motion Planning**: Calculate robot keyframes for the action
4. **Animation Creation**: Apply keyframes to robot armature
5. **Execution**: Play back the generated animation

### Object Recognition
- Automatically categorizes objects by name patterns
- Recognizes: tubes, boxes, tables, parts, containers, tools
- Supports fuzzy matching for flexible naming

- **Sketch Mode**: Start sketches on reference planes
- **Geometric Entities**: Lines, circles, arcs with precise coordinates
- **Dimensions**: Linear, radial, diameter, and angular dimensions
- **Feature Tree**: Hierarchical view of created features

### Workflow

#### 1. Create Reference Planes
```python
# Create standard planes
Robot Studio > CAD Tools > "Create Standard Planes"

# Or create individual planes
- Front Plane (YZ orientation)
- Top Plane (XY orientation) 
- Right Plane (XZ orientation)
```

#### 2. Start Sketch
```python
# Select a reference plane
# Click "Start Sketch"
# Sketch mode becomes active
```

#### 3. Create Sketch Entities
```python
# Lines
Robot Studio > CAD Tools > "Line"
# Specify start point: (0, 0, 0)
# Specify end point: (1, 0, 0)

# Circles
Robot Studio > CAD Tools > "Circle"  
# Specify center: (0, 0, 0)
# Specify radius: 1.0
```

#### 4. Add Dimensions
```python
# Select sketch entities
# Click "Add Dimension"
# Choose dimension type:
# - Linear: Distance between points
# - Radial: Circle radius
# - Diameter: Circle diameter
```

#### 5. Exit Sketch
```python
# Click "Exit Sketch"
# Sketch added to Feature Tree
# Return to 3D modeling mode
```

### SolidWorks Compatibility
- **Same Workflow**: Identical to SolidWorks sketching process
- **Standard Planes**: Front/Top/Right with correct orientations
- **Constraint System**: Dimensional constraints like SolidWorks
- **Feature Tree**: Hierarchical feature organization

### Applications
- **Robot Design**: Sketch robot components and assemblies
- **Fixture Design**: Create custom robot tooling
